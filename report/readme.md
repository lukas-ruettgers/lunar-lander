*** Programming environments ***
The entire code was written in Juptyter Notebooks.
The code for PPO is available in ```./PPO.ipynb```. 
Similarly, the code for the REINFORCE agent and its experiments are included in ```./policygradient.ipynb```.

*** Experiment data ***
Please refer to the ```./data_policygradient``` folder for figures, evaluation videos and metric logs of the REINFORCE agent. The figures are also presented and discussed in the report.

Evaluation videos of the PPO agent are included in the ```./ppo_eval_videos``` folder, while its figures are already included in the report and hence omitted to avoid redundance.
