4 types of files for every run:
1. png file is for the chart and some metrics
2. txt file is for the outputs (the score, avg_score, highscore for each episode)
NOTE, that there is an evaluation performed at every 100 episodes (agent performs on an environment for 5 times, no learning, and an avg score is taken)
3. h5 file is the weights of the agent
4. mp4 file is the clips of the lander
